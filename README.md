## Overview of Project: 
Dana already has a working website with a table that searches data and now wants to add more filters to that table. This project is that expanded table along with an analysis of the search process that we have performed.

This is the landing page of the website with the updated table. I have also added a couple of quality of life features such as a header with a link back to the main page if we wanted to expand this to multiple pages. There is also a hover button on the bottom right that shows up once scrolling down that allows you to move immediately to the top of the page.

## Results: 
Focusing on the table search features on the left side of the page we can examine some of the new ways we can filter the data.

## Summary: 
One drawback to this design is really the lack of parameters for the filter, the user does not know the range of dates. It would be beneficial to probably turn them into either drop downs or filter the results in a more user friendly way. Another recommendation is to add a recent sightings button that filters the data to items that are closest to the current date of the user.
